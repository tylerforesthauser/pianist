# MIDI Analysis and Generation Workflow

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out

## Use Case

Analyze an existing MIDI file to extract musical characteristics, then generate a new composition inspired by it.

## Workflow

1. **Import** - Convert MIDI to JSON (optional, analyze can work directly with MIDI)
2. **Analyze** - Extract musical characteristics with comprehensive analysis:
   - Quality assessment (technical, musical, structure scores)
   - Musical analysis (motifs, phrases, harmony, form)
   - Improvement suggestions
   - Optional AI-assisted naming and description
3. **Generate** - Create new composition (with or without AI)

## With AI Provider

**TODO**: Document workflow with built-in AI

## Without AI Provider

**TODO**: Document workflow using external AI

## Examples

**TODO**: Add examples (style transfer, inspiration)
