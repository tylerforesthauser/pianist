## Guidelines

**Use this directory for:**
- Work-in-progress research
- Temporary design notes
- One-time analysis documents
- Documents that will be consolidated or removed later

**Do not use this for:**
- Permanent project documentation (use root or `docs/`)
- Planning documents (use root: `MISSION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, etc.)
- User-facing documentation (use root or `docs/`)

## Cleanup

- Review and clean up this directory periodically
- Remove documents that are no longer needed
- Consolidate useful information into permanent docs before removing
- Archive historical design decisions if they contain valuable rationale
