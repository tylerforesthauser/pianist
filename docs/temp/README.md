# Temporary Documents

This directory is for temporary documents that are needed during development but are not part of the permanent project documentation.

**Guidelines:**
- Use this directory for documents that are:
  - Work-in-progress research
  - Temporary design notes
  - One-time analysis documents
  - Documents that will be consolidated or removed later
- **Do not** use this for:
  - Permanent project documentation (use root or `docs/`)
  - Planning documents (use root: `MISSION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, etc.)
  - User-facing documentation (use root or `docs/`)

**Cleanup:**
- Review and clean up this directory periodically
- Remove documents that are no longer needed
- Consolidate useful information into permanent docs before removing
